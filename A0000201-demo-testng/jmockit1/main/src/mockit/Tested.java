/**
 * Indicates a class to be tested, with optional automatic instantiation and/or automatic injection of dependencies.
 * This annotation is applicable to instance fields of a test class, and to test method parameters; alternatively, it can be used as a
 * meta-annotation on a user-defined annotation which, in turn, needs to have {@linkplain RetentionPolicy#RUNTIME runtime}
 * {@linkplain Retention retention} and be {@linkplain Target applicable} to {@linkplain ElementType#FIELD fields} and/or
 * {@linkplain ElementType#PARAMETER parameters}.
 * <p/>
 * Every non-<tt>final</tt> tested field and every tested parameter is eligible for automatic instantiation and initialization.
 * By default, automatic instantiation occurs just before a test method is executed.
 * This default can be changed by specifying the {@link #availableDuringSetup} optional attribute as <tt>true</tt> in a tested field
 * declaration (it is ignored if applied to a tested parameter).
 * <p/>
 * Whenever automatic creation occurs, a suitable instance of the tested class is created, initialized, and assigned to the tested field or
 * passed as argument to the tested parameter.
 * Available {@linkplain Injectable injectables} and other <tt>@Tested</tt> values are used, either as argument values for the chosen
 * constructor of the tested class, or as values to set into injected fields of the newly-created tested object.
 * For a given tested object, only <em>preceding</em> tested objects (if any) are regarded as available for injection;
 * other such objects declared after the one being created are disregarded.
 * <tt>@Tested</tt> parameters precede any <tt>@Tested</tt> fields.
 * <p/>
 * For <em>constructor injection</em>, all constructor parameters (if any) must be satisfied with available tested/injectable values.
 * If the tested class has a constructor annotated with the standard CDI annotation "<code>@Inject</code>", then it is the one to be used;
 * otherwise, if there are multiple satisfiable constructors then the one with the most parameters <em>and</em> the widest accessibility
 * (ie, first <tt>public</tt>, then <tt>protected</tt>, then <em>package-private</em>, and finally <tt>private</tt>) is chosen.
 * The matching between injectable values and constructor parameters is done by <em>type</em> when there is only one parameter of a given
 * type; otherwise, by type <em>and name</em>.
 * <p/>
 * <em>Field injection</em> is performed on all tested objects, even when it was not instantiated automatically.
 * Only non-<code>final</code> fields are considered, between those declared in the tested class itself or in one of its super-classes; at
 * this time constructor injection already occurred, so only fields which remain uninitialized are targeted.
 * For each such <em>target</em> field, the value of a still unused injectable of a matching type is assigned, if any is available.
 * When a tested object has multiple target fields of a matching type, not just the type but also the <em>name</em> of each field will be
 * used when looking for available injectables.
 * Finally, if there is no matching and available injectable value for a given target field, it is left unassigned, unless the target field
 * is for a <em>required</em> dependency; note that all fields marked with a DI annotation (such as <tt>@Inject</tt>, <tt>@Autowired</tt>,
 * etc.) indicate required dependencies by default (the use of "<code>@Autowired(required = false)</code>" is respected, if present).
 * <p/>
 * Tested fields/parameters whose declared type is primitive, a primitive wrapper, numeric, or an enum can use the {@link #value} attribute
 * to specify an initial value from a string.
 * <p/>
 * Custom names specified in field annotations from Java EE (<tt>@Resource(name)</tt>, <tt>@Named</tt>) or the Spring framework
 * (<tt>@Qualifier</tt>) are used when looking for a matching <tt>@Injectable</tt> or <tt>@Tested</tt> value.
 * When such a name contains a <tt>-</tt> (dash) or <tt>.</tt> (dot) character, the corresponding camel-cased name is used instead.
 * <p/>
 * Whenever constructor or field injection is used, the value of each injectable goes into <em>at most one</em> matching constructor
 * parameter or instance field of a tested class.
 * <p/>
 * The tested class can be <tt>abstract</tt>.
 * In this case, if the tested field is left null then a subclass implementing all abstract methods is automatically generated and
 * instantiated.
 * The abstract method implementations are automatically <em>mocked</em> so that expectations can be recorded or verified on them.
 * <p/>
 * When the {@link #fullyInitialized} attribute is <tt>true</tt>, all eligible fields in the tested object will get initialized with a
 * suitable instance, which itself is recursively initialized in the same way.
 *

    * be an available {@linkplain Injectable @Injectable} or <tt>@Tested</tt> value of a type assignable to the field type, or a real
    * (unmocked) instance of the field type.
    * <p/>
    * Non-eligible fields are those that have already being assigned from a constructor, or that have a primitive, array, annotation, or JRE
    * type (with the exception of the types described below, which are given special treatment).
    * Also non-eligible are any <tt>static</tt> or <tt>volatile</tt> fields, unless annotated with an <em>injection annotation</em> (one of

    * <p/>
    * For each field of a reference type that would otherwise remain <tt>null</tt>, an attempt is made to automatically create and
    * recursively initialize a suitable real instance.
    * For this attempt to succeed, the type of the field must either be a concrete class having a constructor that can be satisfied by
    * available tested/injectable values and/or by recursively created dependencies, or a known interface (see below) for which a real
    * instance can be created.
    * <p/>
    * Constructor injection is also supported.
    * In this case, the same rules used for injected fields apply to the parameters of the constructor that gets chosen for automatic
    * instantiation.
    * <p/>
    * Currently, the following standard types (some of which are Java EE interfaces) have special support:
    * <ul>
    *    <li>
    *       {@link java.util.logging.Logger}:
    *       a logger is automatically {@linkplain java.util.logging.Logger#getLogger(String) created} with the name of the tested class.
    *    </li>
    *    <li>
    *       {@link javax.sql.DataSource}: a JDBC data source is created and configured according to a matching
    *       {@link javax.annotation.sql.DataSourceDefinition @DataSourceDefinition} in the tested class.
    *    </li>
    *    <li>
    *       {@link javax.inject.Provider Provider&lt;T>}: a provider which produces an instance of type <tt>T</tt> is injected.
    *    </li>
    *    <li>
    *       JPA interfaces {@link javax.persistence.EntityManagerFactory} and {@link javax.persistence.EntityManager}:
    *       created through calls to {@link javax.persistence.Persistence#createEntityManagerFactory(String)} and
    *       {@link javax.persistence.EntityManagerFactory#createEntityManager()}, provided a suitable <tt>META-INF/persistence.xml</tt> file
    *       is available in the runtime classpath.
    *    </li>
    *    <li>
    *       Servlet interfaces {@link javax.servlet.ServletContext} and {@link javax.servlet.http.HttpSession}:
    *       objects that emulate the servlet context and HTTP session are automatically created for use in tests.
    *    </li>
    *    <li>
    *       {@link javax.enterprise.context.Conversation}: an object that emulates a web application's conversation context is created.
    *    </li>
    * </ul>
