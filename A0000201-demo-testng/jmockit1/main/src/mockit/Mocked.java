/**
 * Indicates an instance field of a test class as being a <em>mock field</em>, or a parameter of a test method as a <em>mock parameter</em>;
 * in either case, the declared type of the field/parameter is a <em>mocked type</em>, whose instances are <em>mocked instances</em>.
 * <p/>
 * Mocked types can also be introduced by other annotations: {@linkplain Injectable @Injectable}, {@link Capturing @Capturing}.
 * Their effect is to <em>constrain</em> or <em>extend</em> the mocking capabilities here specified.
 * <p/>
 * Any type can be mocked, except for primitive and array types.
 * A mocked instance of that type is automatically created and assigned to the mock field/parameter, for use when
 * {@linkplain Expectations recording} and/or {@linkplain Verifications verifying} expectations.
 * For a mock <em>field</em>, the test itself can provide the instance by declaring the field as <tt>final</tt> and assigning it the desired
 * instance (or <tt>null</tt>).
 * <p/>
 * The effect of declaring a <tt>@Mocked</tt> type, <em>by default</em>, is that all new instances of that type, as well as those previously
 * created, will also be mocked instances; this will last for the duration of each test where the associated mock field/parameter is in
 * scope.
 * All non-<tt>private</tt> methods of the mocked type will be mocked.
 * <p/>
 * When the mocked type is a class, all super-classes up to but not including <tt>java.lang.Object</tt> are also mocked.
 * Additionally, <em>static methods</em> and <em>constructors</em> are mocked as well, just like instance methods;
 * <em>native</em> methods are also mocked, provided they are <tt>public</tt> or <tt>protected</tt>.
 * <p/>
 * While a method or constructor is mocked, an invocation does not result in the execution of the original code, but in a (generated) call
 * into JMockit, which then responds with either a default or a <em>recorded</em> {@linkplain Expectations#result result} (or with a
 * {@linkplain Expectations#times constraint} violation, if the invocation is deemed to be unexpected).
 * <p/>
 * Mocking will automatically <em>cascade</em> into the return types of all non-<code>void</code> methods belonging to the mocked type,
 * except for non-eligible ones (primitive wrappers, <tt>String</tt>, and collections/maps).
 * When needed, such cascaded returns can be overridden by explicitly recording a return value for the mocked method.
 * If there is a mock field/parameter with the same type (or a subtype) of some cascaded type, then the original instance from that mock
 * field/parameter will be used as the cascaded instance, rather than a new one being created;
 * this applies to all cascading levels, and even to the type of the mock field/parameter itself (ie, if a method in class/interface
 * "<code>A</code>" has return type <tt>A</tt>, then it will return itself by default).
 * Finally, when new cascaded instances are created, {@linkplain Injectable @Injectable} semantics apply.
